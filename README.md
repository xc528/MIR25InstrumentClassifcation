# MIR25InstrumentClassifcation
## How do state of the art methods perform in live settings?
This repository contains the code and experimentation for a Music Information Retrieval (MIR) project analyzing AudioMAE and openL3 embeddings under different acoustic conditions (dry, reverb, distortion). The project investigates k-means clustering conditions of the two models using audio processed with these different conditions.
